 | Programming Assignment 4: Basic Game of Battleship
 | Date: October 17, 2012
 +------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Description: This program simulates the game of Battleship. The game will be
 |              completely text-based. Battleship is a two player Navy game.
 |              The objective of the game is to sink all ships in your enemy's
 |              fleet. The Player to sink his/her enemy's fleet first wins. Both
 |              players' fleets consist of 5 ships that are hidden from the
 |              enemy. Each ship may be differentiated by its "size" (besides
 |              the Cruiser and Submarine) or number of cells it expands on the
 |              game board. The Carrier has 5 cells, Battleship has 4 cells,
 |              Cruiser has 3 cells, Submarine has 3 cells, and the Destroyer
 |              has 2 cells.
